The project centers on the development of an inclusive gaming platform specifically
designed to accommodate individuals with disabilities affecting their arms and hands.
Leveraging advancements in assistive technology, such as motion sensing, facial gesture
recognition, and customizable controls, our platform aims to provide a seamless and enjoyable
gaming experience for users of all abilities. By prioritizing accessibility and user empowerment,
we seek to bridge the gap between mainstream gaming and individuals with disabilities, fostering
a more inclusive and welcoming gaming community.
Our project involves the development of interface that utilizes innovative input methods, such
as head movements and facial gestures, to enable users to control gameplay effectively. By
leveraging emerging technologies like the Emotive Epoc+ device, we can provide alternative
input mechanisms that bypass traditional reliance on manual dexterity.

Additionally, our solution incorporates user-centered design principles to ensure that the
interface is intuitive, user-friendly, and tailored to the unique needs of individuals with
disabilities.
Moreover, collaboration with stakeholders, including individuals
with disabilities, gaming enthusiasts, and accessibility experts, can provide valuable insights and
perspectives throughout the development process.
